This project is an experimental match game solver implemented in C# as a console application. It utilises the A* algorithm, combining the efficiency of a hash table with the data organisation of a heap. The solver is designed to quickly tackle various match games where the objective is to find and match pairs or sequences of items within a grid.

Simply add start and end position for the algorithm to solve.
The program does not have a scrambler so make sure that the problem you provide is solvable.

Example:

Start
{ 6, 0, 8 },
{ 4, 3, 5 },
{ 1, 2, 7 },

End
{ 1, 2, 3 },
{ 4, 5, 6 },
{ 7, 8, 0 },
